# pyDynamoDB


A wrapper for DynamoDB calls using boto3. 

This won't be well documented (yet), as it's really for personal use and an aid to learning DynamoDB with python's boto3 on Amazon Web Services. The files are package as a pip package though, so you can start using it by cloning the repository and then installing locally with 

`pip install .`
